abstract = {Our brain excels at recognizing objects, even when they flash by in a rapid sequence. However, the neural processes determining whether a target image in a rapid sequence can be recognized or not remains elusive. We used electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate the temporal dynamics of brain processes that shape perceptual outcomes in these challenging viewing conditions. Using naturalistic images and advanced multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) techniques, we probed the brain dynamics governing conscious object recognition. Our results show that although initially similar, the processes for when an object can or cannot be recognized diverge around 180 ms post-appearance, coinciding with feedback neural processes. Decoding analyses indicate that gist perception (partial conscious perception) can occur at ∼120 ms through feedforward mechanisms. In contrast, object identification (full conscious perception of the image) is resolved at ∼190 ms after target onset, suggesting involvement of recurrent processing. These findings underscore the importance of recurrent neural connections in object recognition and awareness in rapid visual presentations.}
