# About Me
{: #about-me }

 I am a detail-oriented professional who brings a solid foundation in machine learning and statistics. With  +4 years of hands-on experience in Python programming, I’ve honed my skills in data manipulation, exploration, and maintenance of enterprise data models. I am highly skilled in all aspects of data analysis, including data pre-processing, data manipulation, feature extraction, statistical analysis, and data visualization techniques. I am a dedicated and adaptable professional with excellent communication skills, adept at fitting into various workplaces and collaborating effectively within teams.

# Professional Experiences
{: #professional-experiences }
### Research Assistant 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • Engaging in collaborative research efforts within the framework of a large-scale project (OMMABA), taking place at McGill and Western Universities
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Utilizing various data collection methodologies, including the acquisition of behavioral, EEG, and fMRI data, from cohorts of healthy volunteers
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Demonstrating proficiency in data pre-processing, cleaning, and analysis, ensuring the reliability of collected datasets

### Machine Learning Research Intern
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • Extracted RGB and Optical flow from videos generated using THINGS database
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Assessed the performance of action recognition models (two-stream I3D ConvNet, R(2+1)D ConvNet, and ConvLSTM) under rapid target presentation
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Formed Representational Dissimilarity Matrices (RDMs) and conducted Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) to compare model performance and and brain response patterns
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Highlighted CNN limitations in mimicking brain processing in rapid visual tasks and proposed RNNs as a better approximation

### Graduate Research Assistant
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Proposed a novel hypothesis about object recognition, suggesting the crucial role of recurrent processing in visual system
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Conducted an independent experiment and collected EEG data from human volunteers to investigate the neural dynamics of image processing
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Performed pre-processing, cleaning, and manipulation on 100 GB collected EEG data
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Leveraged machine learning techniques such as Multivariate Analysis and bootstrapping to analyze pre-processed data
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Utilized inferential statistical analysis to confirm the proposed hypothesis

### Teaching Assistant
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Held Python tutorials for Computer Science Fundamentals and managed over 40 students during these tutorial sessions
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Collaborated closely with course instructors to prepare the course material
